# PekkasPlayhouse-Data-Royale

We utilized the Kaggle dataset, Clash Royale Season 18 battles, to develop a logistic regression model that predicts winning outcomes based on X-bow decks before and after the balance changes on December 9, 2020. 
The columns we mostly utilized were winner and loser card IDs, elixir averages, and counts of card types. 
We built a presentation analyzing our findings of a decrease in the likelihood of winning for X-bow decks after it was nerfed, along with Guards, Graveyard, and Heal Spirit.
